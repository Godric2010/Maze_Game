# Debug
The debug library is an engine internal library responsible for displaying debug information at runtime in the engine.

## Scope
This library is only supposed to have some sort of stats overviews at runtime in the engine, independently of the ecs systems.
It is not supposed to create some sort of editor environment or be able to input data to make modifications to the scene.
